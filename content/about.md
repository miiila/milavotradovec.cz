I am a software engineer, currently living in Prague. I do definitely too many things, but I enjoy all of them!

- I work as a research engineer for a great company [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)
- I am helping to change my beloved home country through ones and zeros in [Česko.Digital](https://cesko.digital/)
- I love helping other people to succeed! Should you be looking for a mentor or just wanna chat, [let me know](/mentoring)
- I enjoy solving hard puzzles and hike outdoors; these both desires are combined in our puzzlehunts community [Šifrovačky.cz](https://sifrovacky.cz/)
- I also help puzzlehunts to satisfy their players, currently working on [TMOU](https://tmou.cz) and [Kachna](https://kachna.sifrovacky.cz/)
- I play the guitar, [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/14792301), [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40273562-m-la-votradovec), [program for fun](https://projecteuler.net/profile/miiila.png) and travel
